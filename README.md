# GoogleTrendsScraper
Aims to scrape statistics to certain words from Google Trends using a time delay

OPEN FOR HELP :)

This script works perfectly fine however the time delay is not long enough and Google will eventually block the requests which results in the error 429. This means that to many request were made in a short time period from that network. Unfortunately I cannot enlargen the delay as I am working with a preset time window that has to be held constant for comparison reasons. This is why this is still work in progress.

Note: Some lines had to be censored as this is part of an ongoing research. They can be replaced with other words of choice.

Note to myself: The 7 day timeframe will be still valid as long the scraping takes place on the same day; I could enlargen the delay to fit in a day (maybe 8am-11pm?); However the granulation in that timeframe is hourly so information might be lost.
